# To-Do List Web App

[![Standard - JavaScript Style Guide](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)

A simple to-do list web app. I am building this to learn things.

To run it locally, clone it, then run

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will set nodemon running, which will automatically restart the server when you make changes to the code.

I would not recommend running this app on a live server.

Navigate to [http://localhost:1337/api/todo](http://localhost:1337/api/todo) to see a short sample to-do list.

## Automated Tests

To check the code against the StandardJS style guide, run

```
npm run lint
```

To run the unit tests, run

```
npm run test
```

## Goals and Feature Requests

* Automate tests
